## Introduction

In this chapter we will explain how to get the program code onto your NodeMCU. You can start with that as soon as you have you microcontroller at hand, no other parts are needed. For later testing, you will however need at least the temperature sensor


## Open the program in Arduino IDE

In the current release there are (among others) two files:
* rancilio-pid.ino
* userConfig.h

rancilio-pid.ino contains the actual program while userConfig.h holds all user specific configuration options.

When you open the .ino file, the other files which belond to the project are automatically opend in separate tabs within Arduino IDE and can be edited and saved directly from here.


### Preferences

The most important functions have to be parameterized in userConfig.h. Please remember to set the correct PID mode, temperature sensor and possibly display.

```

### Wifi

Under Wifi please specify the desired hostname of the NodeMCU, the SSID to connect to and the according Wifi password. Please also check that your SSID doesn't contain any blank spaces or special characters as those often lead to problems.

```
#define HOSTNAME "Rancilio"

#define D_SSID "wifiname"

#define PASS "wifipass"
```

### Blynk

Under Blynk, enter your Auth token from Part 1 as AUTH.

```
#define AUTH "myauth"
#define BLYNKADDRESS "blynk.clevercoffee.de"         // IP-Address of used blynk server
#define BLYNKPORT 8080  //Port for blynk server

```

### PID

Here you can define your initial PID values or just start with the "factory defaults"

### OTA

Here, **O**ver **T**he **A**ir update is set up. This is important once your NodeMCU is buried deep in your machine and you want to update to a new software version.

## Flashing the code

Make sure the Auth token as well as the Wifi data you have entered is correct.

Also make sure you have chosen the right COM port for flashing. If you are unsure, you can check the COM port number in device manager

![](../img/software-part-II/34.png)

![](../img/software-part-II/35.png)

Next, click on the arrow symbol to start the upload to the Microcontroller

## Testing

If everything has worked fine, you can see the communication between your NodeMCU and Blynk in the Serial Monitor

![](../img/software-part-II/36.png)

If that has worked and if you already have a temperature sensor connected, you can see you current room temperature in the Blynk app. Now you can start adding more and more parts to you setup, like the SSR or a display and continue testing.

### perform OTA update (optional)

In order to do an OTA update, the machine has to be turned on and has to be in the same network as your PC running Arduino IDE. You will now see your NodeMCU under Tools > Port > Network > "Hostname <IP-Address>". Choose this entry and start flashing the software just as before.
