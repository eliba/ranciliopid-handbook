# PCB

To make it easier for you to get started with CleverCoffee, we developed a printed circuit board (PCB) to place the ESP32 on.
This PCB provides all necessary connectors and matches the GPIO layout of the ESP32 to our software.

Development of the PCB layout is done in a separate repository. You can find it here: [CleverCoffee Hardware Repository](https://github.com/rancilio-pid/clevercoffee-hardware).

In this chapter you can find all relevant information about the PCB in its different revisions.
